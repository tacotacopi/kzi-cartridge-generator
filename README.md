# KZI Cartridge Generator
An easy-to-use GUI for generating custom `.kzi` (Kazeta information file) files for your [Kazeta](https://kazeta.org/) cartridges ~~that totally wasn't generated by AI~~. Useful for those who may be nervous using a text editor.

## How to Use
1. Follow the instructions on the [Kazeta Wiki](https://github.com/kazetaos/kazeta/wiki/Creating-Carts) for prepping your cartridge for first-time setup. Your cartridge folder structure should look something like:
- a folder named "content" that contains the game's executable
- an icon for the game in **PNG** format, that's either 32 x 32 px or 64 x 64 px

As an example, here I'm setting up [*Dudelings*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905160/Dudelings_Arcade_Sportsball/):

2. Download the KZI Cartridge Generator AppImage from the [Releases](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kzi-cartridge-generator/releases) page. You may need to mark the AppImage as an executable with `chmod +x KZI_Cartridge_Generator-x86_64.AppImage`.

Alternatively, if you would rather use the latest commit:
```
git clone https://github.com/the-outcaster/kzi-cartridge-generator.git
cd kzi-cartridge-generator/
python main.py
```
Obviously, since the application is using Python, make sure this is installed on your system.

3. Run KZI Cartidge Generator. Fill in the fields as required, including the name of the game, the game ID, the file path to the executable, the game icon (needs to be **PNG**), and the launcher type.

4. Click "Generate .kzi File" when finished. Save the `cart.kzi` file on the root of your cartridge.

5. If you need to use a runtime, click the appropriate button for the operating system the game was designed for to download the runtime file. Save it to the root of your cartridge. A complete cartridge might look something like this:

6. Eject the cartridge from your system and try testing it out on your Kazeta console!

Note that if your cartridge doesn't launch, you may need to double-check the `.kzi` file and modify its contents -- especially the `Exec=` parameter -- to ensure that it runs properly.
